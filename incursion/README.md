There's nothing to see here

### Installing

Create a virtual environment with `python -m venv .venv`

Start the thing with `.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`

Install shit with `python -m pip install django~=4.0.0` and `python -m pip install channels`

Create an admin user with `python manage.py createsuperuser`

Run the thing with `python manage.py runserver`

When in doubt, `python manage.py migrate`

Well it works on my machine
