# Project Keqei

I dumped the entire code of project keqei here. There's nothing but the login screen and a character screen, and a bunch of data.

There is no database and everything including the passwords are stored unencrypted in a fucking json file.

When I wrote it last year, only god and I understands the code
Now, only god does.

Good luck to whoever that wants to read the code. I wont.

### Running the thing
get into the js folder

run `npm install`

then `node server.js`

then open `index.html`
